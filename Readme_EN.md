# Settings

The mod adds a few new settings to Among Us (in addition to the role settings):

- **Streamer Mode:** You can activate the streamer mode in the Among Us settings. It hides the lobby code, the custom server ip and the custom server port. You can set a custom lobby code replacement text, by changing the _Streamer Mode Replacement Text_ in the `BepInEx\config\me.eisbison.theotherroles.cfg` file.
- **Number of Impostors:** The number of Impostor count be set inside a lobby
- **Map:** The map can be changed inside a lobby
- **Maximum Number Of Meetings:** You can set the maximum number of meetings that can be called in total (Every player still has personal maximum of buttons, but if the maximum number of meetings is reached you can't use your meetings even if you have some left. Impostor and Jackal meetings also count)
- **Allow Skips On Emergency Meetings:** If set to false, there will not be a skip button in emergency meetings. If a player does not vote, they'll vote themself.
- **Hide Player Names:** Hides the names of all players that have role which is unknown to you. Team Lovers/Impostors/Jackal still see the names of their teammates. Impostors can also see the name of the Spy and everyone can still see the age of the mini.
- **Allow Parallel MedBay Scans:** Allows players to perform their MedBay scans at the same time
- **Ghosts Can See Roles**
- **Ghosts Can See Votes**
- **Ghosts Can See The Number Of Remaining Tasks**
- **Dleks:** You are now able to select the Dleks map.
- **Task Counts:** You are now able to select more tasks.
- **Role Summary:** When a game ends there will be a list of all players and their roles and their task progress
- **Darker/Lighter:** Displays color type of each player in meetings

### Task Count Limits per map

You can configure:

- Up to 4 common tasks
- Up to 23 short tasks
- Up to 15 long tasks

Please note, that if the configured option exceeds the available number of tasks of a map, the tasks will be limited to that number of tasks. \
Example: If you configure 4 common tasks on Airship crewmates will only receive 2 common tasks, as airship doesn't offer more than 2 common tasks.

| Map              | Common Tasks | Short Tasks | Long Tasks |
| ---------------- | :----------: | :---------: | :--------: |
| Skeld / Dleks    |      2       |     19      |     8      |
| Mira HQ /QH ariM |      2       |     13      |     11     |
| Polus / suloP    |      4       |     14      |     15     |
| Airship          |      2       |     23      |     15     |

# Roles

We are still improving the role assignment system. It's not that intuitive right now, but it's more flexible than the older one
if you're using it right.

First you need to choose how many special roles of each kind (Impostor/Neutral/Crewmate) you want in the game.
The count you set will only be reached, if there are enough Crewmates/Impostors in the game and if enough roles are set to be in the game (i.e. they are set to > 0%). The roles are then being distributed as follows:

- First all roles that are set to 100% are being assigned to arbitrary players.
- After that each role that has 10%-90% selected adds 1-9 tickets to a ticket pool (there exists a ticket pool for Crewmates, Neutrals and Impostors). Then the roles will be selected randomly from the pools as long it's possible (until the selected number is reached, until there are no more Crewmates/Impostors or until there are no more tickets). If a role is selected from the pool, obviously all the tickets of that role are being removed.
- The Mafia, Lovers and Mini are being selected independently (without using the ticket system) according to the spawn chance you selected. After that the Crewmate, Neutral and Impostor roles are selected and assigned in a random order.

**Example:**\
Settings: 2 special Crewmate roles, Snitch: 100%, Hacker: 10%, Tracker: 30%\
Result: Snitch is assigned, then one role out of the pool [Hacker, Tracker, Tracker, Tracker] is being selected\
Note: Changing the settings to Hacker: 20%, Tracker: 60% would statistically result in the same outcome.

# Source code

It's bad I know, this is a side project and my second week of modding. So there are no best practices around here.
You can use parts of the code but don't copy paste the whole thing. Make sure you give credits to the other developers, because some parts of the code are based on theirs.

# Translation

As of v2.9.0, The Other Roles GM now supports translation into other languages. To add a new language, add translations to [Strings.xlsx](/Strings.xlsx) and submit a pull request.
